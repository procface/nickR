# nickR

A package for secret santa randomisation

## Ideas

  - List of names to be submitted; a unique and different name returned
    for each item in the list.
  - Nobody can gift themselves a present.
  - Nobody should gift that person a present from whom they also receive a gift.
  - Restriction on pairings which should not be chosen - separate vector
    of groupings in data frame.

## Shiny app

  - Email addresses to be added, so all participants receive a
    notification for whom they have to purchase a present.
  - Manager can receive the complete list in case they wish to confirm
    selections are unique.
